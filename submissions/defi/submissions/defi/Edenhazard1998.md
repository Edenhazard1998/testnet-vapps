# vApp Proposal: Decentralized Micro-Lending Platform

## Category
defi

## Description
This vApp is a decentralized micro-lending platform allowing users to provide and access small loans with verifiable trust using Soundness Layer zkProofs.  
Lenders can confirm borrower reputation and repayment history without compromising privacy, while borrowers can access funds securely and transparently.

## Technical Architecture
- Loan requests submitted via web interface or Discord bot.  
- Borrower reputation & history hashed and verified using **Soundness CLI**.  
- zkProofs confirm borrower trustworthiness without revealing sensitive data.  
- Lending and repayment recorded off-chain with proofs verified on Soundness Layer.  
- Future extension: automated interest calculation and rewards for reliable borrowers.

## Timeline
- **Week 1:** Setup repo & integrate Soundness CLI for loan proof generation  
- **Week 2:** Implement borrower/lender interface & zkProof verification  
- **Week 3:** MVP: handle micro-loans with verified trust  
- **Week 4:** Deploy on testnet & dashboard for lenders/borrowers
